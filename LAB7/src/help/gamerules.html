	<h1>Mah Jong Solitaire Game Rules</h1>
	<p>Mahjong solitaire or MahJongg solitaire also known as Shanghai solitaire, single-player mahjong or one-player mahjong, is a solitaire matching game that uses a set of Mahjong tiles. The 144 tiles are arranged in special layouts with their faces upwards. A tile that can be moved left or right without disturbing other tiles is said to be exposed. Exposed pairs of identical tiles (Flower and Seasons tiles in the same group being considered identical) are removed from the layout one at a time, gradually exposing the lower layers to play. The aim of the game is to clear the layout by pairing up all the tiles. The game is finished when either the layout is empty, or there are no exposed pairs remaining.</p>
